# Basic game concepts

Below you can find a short high level overview of basic game concepts.

## Public works

Player accumulates `public work points` by specialized buildings or `slavery`. Then he can spend those points to build various tile improvements.

Tile improvements consume some `public work points` per turn. When run out of `public work points` random tile improvement is damaged.

## Military

All military units have the following attributes:

- power
- movement points
- health points
- supply points
- ...various bonuses

Military units can stack together creating armies. The speed of the army is limited by it's slowest unit. Big armies have movement penalties.

#### **Supplies**:

Supplies is the concept that limits the power of stacks of doom and adds a bit of tactics and deep to the combat. It also limits the potential of military units being used as scouts and explorers.

- Supply points will deteriorate when there is no clear path to a friendly city.
- Supply lines (paths) cannot go in vicinity of enemy units.
- Automatic supply lines work only for close distances. For long distances a special `supply cargo` unit must be built.
- When supplies are deteriorated, the health points will start to decrease which can lead to the unit being disbanded.
- Supply points can be replenished by pillaging tile improvements or cities, by defeating enemy army and taking over their supplies or by intercepting enemy supply units.
