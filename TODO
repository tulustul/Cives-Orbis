Bugs:
  ☐ next turn should hide city view
  ☐ map generator: fix rivers placement - loops, dead ends etc.
  ☐ unit path is showing wrong turns count
  ☐ webgl fonts scaling
  ✔ yields change received when selecting a unit @done(20-06-09 20:01)
  ✔ yields change received when using pathfinding @done(20-06-09 20:01)
  ✔ land units can access sea and vice versa under some cirmumstances @done(21-04-03 12:41)

Performance:
  ☐ core: distinguish between commands that mutate the state and those which don't
  ☐ core: disable collector while game is loading
  ☐ renderer: render terrain to texture so that not the entire view have to been rerendered each frame
  ☐ core: pathfinding is not optimized yet
  ☐ core: avoid zoc and supplies recalculations when initializing the game. Those should be handled in a single precomputation pass.
  ☐ core: update zoc and supplies once in moveAlongPath instead of in _move

Refactor:
  ☐ renderer: still a mess
  ☐ core: minimize boilerplate in serialization (not sure if worth it)

Minor features:
  ☐ closing city view should restore previous camera transform
  ☐ nicer start game view
  ☐ tooltips for more ui elements
  ☐ autosaving
  ☐ city production queue
  ☐ previous/next city button in the city view
  ✔ ai only matches with autoplay @done(20-06-14 19:50)
  ☐ proper starting locations
  ☐ map generator: more realistic orogeny
  ☐ map generator: climate based on mountain ranges and sea currents
  ☐ improve unit visibility range
  ☐ improve city visibility range
  ☐ pathfinding: verify path each turn
  ☐ unit animations

Major features:
  ✔ naval units @done(20-06-06 15:05)
  ☐ AI combat
  ☐ AI exploring
  ☐ statistics and charts
  ☐ resources - increase tile yields
  ☐ happiness
  ✔ `fog of war` - grey out tiles not visible by units and cities @done(20-06-07 23:03)
  ☐ tile improvements damaging when not enough public works
  ✔ embarkment @done(20-06-14 19:50)
  ☐ armies/generals
  ☐ supply lines
  ☐ cities overview panel
  ☐ slavery
  ☐ tribes and civ traits
  ☐ barbarians
  ☐ diplomacy
  ☐ nations
  ☐ trade

Others:
  ☐ think about unit tests (how to nicely mock the map?)
