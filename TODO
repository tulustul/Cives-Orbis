Bugs:
  ☐ showing city's area should take player's explored tiles into account
  ☐ next turn should hide city view
  ☐ fix rivers placement - loops, dead ends etc.
  ☐ unit path is showing wrong turns count
  ☐ TileContainer raises exception when game is loaded
  ☐ minimap doesn't fully fill it's viewport
  ✔ selecting building to build should hide it from production list @done(20-05-07 21:38)
  ☐ ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError when opening city view

Minor features:
  ☐ ESC for closing current view
  ☐ closing city view should restore previous camera transform
  ☐ nicer start game view
  ☐ tooltips for more ui elements
  ☐ block next turn until all units/buildings have orders (and jump to them)
  ☐ hide city growth/production in foreign cities
  ☐ when zoomed out display areas instead of borders
  ☐ autosaving
  ☐ better city expansion - distance to next tile should be limited basing on city's size
  ☐ differentiate between different units on the map
  ✔ city products can have requirements @done(20-05-07 20:42)
  ☐ city production queue

Major features:
  ☐ implement `city work on` (how to call it properly?).
    ☐ `food` transforms 25% of production into food
    ☐ `public works` produces `public works points`
  ☐ tile improvements:
    ☐ `farm` +1 food
    ☐ `workshop` +1 production
    ☐ `road` 0.5 movement cost
  ☐ resources - increase tile yields
  ☐ `fog of war` - grey out tiles not visible by units and cities
  ☐ AI :/
  ☐ armies
  ☐ city conquest
  ☐ slavery

Long term ideas:
