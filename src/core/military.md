- units stacking is unlimited
- when moved to the same tile, the units merge into one
- the unit has size property e.g. a warrior with strength 3 and size 10 (float) - meaning it's 10 warriors stacked
- the units can split (1 is a minimal division)
- the unit starts with size 1 and it can dropped below it after the combat. It's like hitpoints but cannot be restored
- stacks of units of different types form an army with stacks as children
- stack/army combat is a series of 1 on 1 fights - always pick the best unit from both stacks/armies
- stacks of doom mitigation:
  - flanking - surrounded stacks perform worse
  - artillery does collateral damage to the stack
  - slow - moves with the speed of the slowest unit
  - easy to cut from supply lines (is supplies are a thing)
- flanking, must be the opposite sides of the attacked units
