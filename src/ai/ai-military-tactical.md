# Military Tactical AI Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **Unit Awareness**: The AI must track positions, health, and status of all friendly and enemy units.
- **Threat Assessment**: Evaluate and prioritize threats based on proximity, strength, and objectives.
- **Cover Utilization**: Identify and move units to optimal cover positions.
- **Flanking Maneuvers**: Plan and execute flanking strategies to outmaneuver opponents.
- **Resource Management**: Allocate limited resources (e.g., ammo, abilities) efficiently during engagements.
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Adapt tactics in real-time based on changing battlefield conditions.
- **Coordination**: Enable units to coordinate attacks and defenses as a group.
- **Retreat and Regroup**: Recognize when to withdraw and regroup units to avoid unnecessary losses.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: AI decisions must be computed within 100ms per turn.
- **Scalability**: Support up to 100 units per side without significant performance degradation.
- **Configurability**: Allow tuning of AI aggressiveness, defensiveness, and risk tolerance.
- **Debugging Support**: Provide logging and visualization tools for AI decision processes.

## Constraints

- Must integrate with existing game engine APIs.
- Should be modular to allow future enhancements.
- Must avoid predictable or repetitive behavior patterns.
